UVA 11087 - Divisibility Testing

You will be given a list of n integers, < a1 a2 a3 . . . an > and an integer k. Find out the number of ways
of choosing 2 integers (ai
, aj ), such that ai ≤ aj and 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n and i ̸= j and (ai + aj ) is divisible by
k. Every pair must be distinct. Two pairs, (a, b) and (c, d), are equal if a is equal to c and b is equal
to d.
Suppose we are given 5 integers < 41223 > and k = 1. There are 7 ways of choosing different pairs
that meets the above restrictions: (1, 2)(1, 3)(1, 4)(2, 2)(2, 3)(2, 4)(3, 4).

Input
The first line of input contains an integer T that determines the number of test cases. Each test case
contains two lines. The first line consists of two integers n and k. The next line contains n integers.
The i-th integer gives the value of ai
.
Output
For each test case, output the case number followed by the number of ways to choose the pairs.
Constraints
• T < 100
• 1 < n < 100001
• 0 < k < 501
• |ai
| < 10000001 for any i

Sample Input

5 1
4 1 2 2 3
5 2
4 1 2 2 3

Sample Output
Case 1: 7
Case 2: 3
